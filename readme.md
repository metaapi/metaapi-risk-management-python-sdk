MetaApi risk management API is a cloud API for executing trading challenges and competitions. You can use this API for e.g. if you want to launch a proprietary trading company like FTMO. The API is also useful for trading firms/teams which have to enforce trading risk restrictions.

MetaApi risk management API is a member of MetaApi project ([https://metaapi.cloud](https://metaapi.cloud)), a powerful cloud forex trading API which supports both MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platforms.

MetaApi is a paid service, however API access to one MetaTrader account is free of charge.

The [MetaApi pricing](https://metaapi.cloud/#pricing) was developed with the intent to make your charges less or equal to what you would have to pay for hosting your own infrastructure. This is possible because over time we managed to heavily optimize
our MetaTrader infrastructure. And with MetaApi you can save significantly on application development and
maintenance costs and time thanks to high-quality API, open-source SDKs and convenience of a cloud service.
